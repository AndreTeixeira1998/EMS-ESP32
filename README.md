# EMS-ESP

EMS-ESP is a open-source system to communicate with **EMS** (Energy Management System) based boilers, thermostats and other modules from manufacturers like Bosch, Buderus, Nefit, Junkers and Sieger.

The code is writen for the Espressif **ESP8266** microcontroller and supports a telnet console for real-time monitoring and configuration and customizable MQTT support for publishing the information to a home automation system such as Home Assistant or Domoticz.
