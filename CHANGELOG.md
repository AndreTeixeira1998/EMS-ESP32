# [3.2.0] August 6 2021

## Added

- support for IPv6 (web/api/mqtt, not syslog yet) [#83](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/83)
- System Log in Web UI will show current time if the NTP Service is enabled [#82](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/82)
- Network settings for Tx-power, WiFi-bandwidth, WiFi-sleepmode [#83](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/83)
- optional low CPU clockrate (160 MHz) [#83](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/83)
- select format for enumerated values in web
- settings for water hysteresis on/off
- dallas sensor name editable. `sensorname` console-command, replace sensorid with a unique name [#84](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/84)
- 'restart' system command. Can be invoked via API with authentication. [#87](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/87)
- add Download button in Web UI for log

## Fixed

- set mode allow numbers
- Junkers thermostat shows mode as selected by set_mode
- HA thermostat mode if bool-format: numbers is selected
- Web UI System Log sometimes skipped a few log messages when watching real-time
- fix wwactivated [#89](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/89)
- don't show commands (like reset) as Device values in the Web or Console

## Changed

- removed Rx echo failures counting as incomplete telegrams. Bad telegrams show as Warning and not Errors. [#80](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/80)
- add upload_sec to `api/system/info` and removed # from some names to keep consistent with MQTT heartbeat
- added debug target to PlatformIO build to help hunt down system crashes
- enumerated values always start at zero
- maintenance settings for time/date as extra setting
- move api/mqtt formats to `settings`, add `enum format`
- UI improvements for editing Dallas Sensor details
- RESTful GET commands can also require authentication (via bearer access token) for better security
- Updated AsyncMqttClient to 0.9.0 and ArduinoJson to 6.18.3
- Download buttons for settings and info under the Help tab

# [3.1.1] June 26 2021

## Changed

- new command called `commands` which lists all available commands. `ems-esp/api/{device}/commands`
- More Home Assistant icons to match the UOMs
- new API. Using secure access tokens and OpenAPI standard. See `doc/EMS-ESP32 API.md` and [#50](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/50)
- show log messages in Web UI [#71](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/71)

## Fixed

- HA thermostat mode was not in sync with actual mode [#66](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/66)
- Don't publish rssi if Wifi is disabled and ethernet is being used
- Booleans are shown as true/false in API GETs

## Changed

- `info` command always shows full names in API. For short names query the device or name directly, e.g. `http://ems-esp/api/boiler`
- free memory is shown in kilobytes
- boiler's warm water entities have ww added to the Home Assistant entity name [#67](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/67)
- improved layout and rendering of device values in the WebUI, also the edit value screen

# [3.1.0] May 4 2021

## Changed

- Mock API to simulate an ESP, for testing web
- Able to write values from the Web UI
- check values with `"cmd":<valuename>` and data empty or `?`
- set hc for values and commands by id or prefix `hc<x>`+separator, separator can be any char

## Fixed

- Don't create Home Assistant MQTT discovery entries for device values that don't exists (#756 on EMS-ESP repo)
- Update shower MQTT when a shower start is detected
- S32 board profile

## Changed

- Icon for Network
- MQTT Formatting payload (nested vs single) is a pull-down option
- moved mqtt-topics and texts to local_EN, all topics lower case
- Re-enabled Shower Alert (still experimental)
- lowercased Flow temp in commands
- system console commands to main

# [3.0.1] March 30 2021

## Added

- power settings, disabling BLE and turning off Wifi sleep
- Rx and Tx counts to Heartbeat MQTT payload
- ethernet support
- id to info command to show only a heatingcircuit
- add sending devices that are not listed to 0x07

- support for chunked MQTT payloads to allow large data sets > 2kb
- external Button support (#708) for resetting to factory defaults and other actions
- new console set command in `system`, `set board_profile <profile>` for quickly enabling cabled ethernet connections without using the captive wifi portal
- added in MQTT nested mode, for thermostat and mixer, like we had back in v2
- cascade MC400 (product-id 210) (3.0.0b6), power values for heating sources (3.0.1b1)

- extended length of IP/hostname from 32 to 48 chars (#676)
- check flowsensor for `tap_water_active`
- mqtt prefixed with `Base`
- count Dallas sensor fails
- switch from SPIFFS to LITTLEFS
- added ID to MQTT payloads which is the Device's product ID and used in HA to identify a unique HA device
- increased MQTT buffer and reduced wait time between publishes
- updated to the latest ArduinoJson library
- some names of mqtt-tags like in v2.2.1
- new ESP32 partition side to allow for smoother OTA and fallback
- network Gateway IP is optional (#682)emsesp/EMS-ESP
