Welcome to EMS-ESP! A small project to read and write to EMS controller heating devices.

Follow these steps to get EMS-ESP up and running:

- [Build](Building-your-own-test-circuit) or buy an EMS interface board. I highly recommend purchasing a EMS Gateway from BBQKees. Go to https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/

- Get an ESP8266 dev board (Wemos D1, Lolin, Nodemcu or equivalent)
  
- Build or download the firmware](Building-firmware)
  
- [Upload the firmware](Uploading-firmware)
  
- Switch it on
  
- [Configure the settings](Configure-firmware)
  
- [Monitor what is happening](Running-and-Monitoring)
